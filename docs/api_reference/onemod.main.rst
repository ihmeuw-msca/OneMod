onemod.main
===========

.. automodule:: onemod.main
    :members: load_pipeline, load_stage, evaluate

TODO: Update docstrings

..
   These functions are in the main.py module, but some functions
   (load_pipeline and load_stage) can also be imported via
   from onemod import load_pipeline. How should this be reflected in
   the documentation?
