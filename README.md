# OneMod

OneMod is a Python package that provides a framework for building and evaluating
single-parameter models. It is designed to be modular, allowing users to easily
add new models and evaluation metrics. OneMod is built on top of the other
IHME tools.

OneMod is being actively developed by the Institute for Health Metrics and is
beta software. It is not yet ready for production use.

For instructions on how to install and use OneMod, please refer to the
[documentation](https://ihmeuw-msca.github.io/OneMod/).
